\title{Add a categorical position scale to the plot}
\usage{
pscategorical(plot, variable = "x", name = "", expand = c(0.01, 0.6))
}
\arguments{
\item{plot}{ggplot object}

\item{variable}{axis ("x" or "y")}

\item{name}{name of the scale (used in the legend)}

\item{expand}{expansion vector (numeric vector, multiplicative and additive
expansion).  Defaults to adding 0.6 on either end of the scale.}
}
\description{
A categorical scale converts a factor into a numerical representation
very simply: by using \code{as.numeric}.  This means that levels
will be placed a integer locations in the same order that they
appear in the levels of the factor (see \code{\link{levels}}).
}
\details{
If you want to reorder (or combine) categories, currently the best way
to do this is to modify the original factors.  In a future version of ggplot
I will probably expand the categorical scale so that you can do that here.

This scale is added to the plot automatically when you use a categorical
variable in the x or y aesthetics.  You shouldn't need to to call this function
unless (for some reason) you want to change the expansion factor.
}
\examples{
p <- ggpoint(ggplot(mtcars, aesthetics=list(x=cyl, y=mpg)))
pscategorical(p, "x") # no change, because already categorical
pscategorical(p, "y") # chops into discrete segments
}
