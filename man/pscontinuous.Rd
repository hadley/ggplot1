\description{
There are a few useful things that you can do with \code{pscontinuous}:
}
\details{
\itemize{
 \item set plot limits explicitly (with \code{range})
 \item transform the scale (with \code{transform})
 \item explicitly set where the axis labels (and grid lines) should appear (with \code{breaks})
}

Note, that if you explicitly set the axis range, you may want to use
\code{\link{expand_range}} to add a little extra room on each side.

When transforming an axes, you need to supply the transforming function
and it's inverse (used to create pretty axis labels).  I have created
a few common ones for you:

\itemize{
  \item \code{trans_log10}: log base 10
  \item \code{trans_log2}: log base 2
  \item \code{trans_inverse}: inverse
  \item \code{trans_sqrt}: square root
}
}
\examples{
p <- ggpoint(ggplot(mtcars, aesthetics=list(x=mpg, y=disp)))
pscontinuous(p, "x", range=c(20,30))
pscontinuous(p, "y", breaks=seq(100, 400, 50))
pscontinuous(p, "y", transform=trans_inverse)
pscontinuous(p, "x", transform=trans_sqrt)
pscontinuous(p, "x", transform=trans_log10)
pscontinuous(p, "x", transform=trans_log10, breaks=seq(10,30, 5))
